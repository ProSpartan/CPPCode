# CPPCode
Making examples and other things in C++ code.

Most of these example will most likely not be portable as I am developing on windows with Visual Studio. If anyone wants to make them portable, then feel free to commit changes.

Output Handler: This example shows how to use a base class, inherited by two other classes that do similar things. Using the base class as the variable definition and the derived class as the assignment, this example will show a method in which you can cast to a derived class inline and use the functions within.
